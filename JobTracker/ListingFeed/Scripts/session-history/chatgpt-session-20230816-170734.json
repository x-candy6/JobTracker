Sign up for a Google Cloud account and enable the Google Maps Platform.\n2. Create a new project and enable the Directions API in the Google Cloud Console.\n3. Generate an API key for your project.\n4. Make a GET request to the Directions API endpoint, providing your API key and the source and destination GPS coordinates in the URL.\n\nExample Request:\n```\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=START_LAT,START_LONG&destination=END_LAT,END_LONG&key=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\nReplace START_LAT, START_LONG with the latitude and longitude of the starting point, and END_LAT, END_LONG with the latitude and longitude of the destination.\n\nThe response will contain detailed information about the route, including the estimated travel time in seconds, distance, and step-by-step instructions.\n\nPlease note that the Directions API is a paid service beyond a certain usage limit. Make sure to check the pricing and billing information on the Google Cloud Platform website."

            "content": "To use the Google Maps Directions API to find estimated travel time via car between two GPS coordinates using Python, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already. You can do this by running the command `pip install requests` in your terminal.\n\n2. Import the `requests` module in your Python script:\n```python\nimport requests\n```\n\n3. Define your API key and the source and destination GPS coordinates:\n```python\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nstart_coordinates = 'START_LAT,START_LONG'\nend_coordinates = 'END_LAT,END_LONG'\n```\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key, and enter the latitude and longitude values for the start and end locations.\n\n4. Construct the request URL:\n```python\nurl = f'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin={start_coordinates}&destination={end_coordinates}&key={api_key}'\n```\n\n5. Send a GET request to the constructed URL using `requests.get()`:\n```python\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n```\n\n6. Parse the JSON response:\n```python\ndata = response.json()\n```\n\n7. Extract the estimated travel time from the response:\n```python\ntravel_time = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['duration']['text']\n```\n\nThe `travel_time` variable will now contain the estimated travel time.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n```python\nimport requests\n\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nstart_coordinates = 'START_LAT,START_LONG'\nend_coordinates = 'END_LAT,END_LONG'\n\nurl = f'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin={start_coordinates}&destination={end_coordinates}&key={api_key}'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\ndata = response.json()\n\ntravel_time = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['duration']['text']\nprint(f\"The estimated travel time by car is: {travel_time}\")\n```\n\nRemember to replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, `START_LAT,START_LONG`, and `END_LAT,END_LONG` with the appropriate values."

            "content": "To retrieve the distance as well from the Google Maps Directions API, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. After parsing the JSON response, you can extract the distance value in a similar way as the travel time:\n```python\ndistance = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['distance']['text']\n```\n\n2. Now, you can print or use the `distance` variable to obtain the distance information.\n\nHere's an updated example incorporating the distance calculation:\n```python\nimport requests\n\napi_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\nstart_coordinates = 'START_LAT,START_LONG'\nend_coordinates = 'END_LAT,END_LONG'\n\nurl = f'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin={start_coordinates}&destination={end_coordinates}&key={api_key}'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\ndata = response.json()\n\ntravel_time = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['duration']['text']\ndistance = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['distance']['text']\n\nprint(f\"The estimated travel time by car is: {travel_time}\")\nprint(f\"The distance between the two points is: {distance}\")\n```\n\nEnsure that you replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, `START_LAT,START_LONG`, and `END_LAT,END_LONG` with the appropriate values in this code snippet."
